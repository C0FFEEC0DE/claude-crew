# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
This plugin-level changelog records the migration from the copied-`~/.claude`
profile (the `claudecfg/` layout installed via `./install.sh`) to a distributable
Node.js ESM plugin runtime. The repository-root `CHANGELOG.md` covers the older
profile history; entries here begin with the plugin.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **Per-agent loop-block isolation (ADR-0002).** The `subagent_stop` loop-block
  counter is keyed by `agent_id` in a `subagent_stop_blocks` map instead of a
  session-global scalar, so three *different* subagents returning identical
  invalid output can no longer accumulate to a 3-strike hard stop. Persistence
  flows through per-key `map_set`/`map_delete` events (concurrent writers for
  different agents survive each other) plus a `map_clear` event for the turn
  reset — every `subagent_stop_blocks` mutation is now a typed `map_*` event.

- **Honor `stop_hook_active` (ADR-0003).** The Stop hook now yields on a
  `stop_hook_active` re-invocation instead of re-blocking up to 3×, matching the
  standard Claude Code loop-prevention contract. The yield is gated on evidence
  of a prior block (`hasPriorStopBlock`), so a runtime that erroneously sets the
  flag on a first Stop cannot silently disable enforcement. The 3× counter
  remains as a backstop for runtimes that omit the flag.

- **Namespace stripping in agent-label canonicalization (ADR-0004).** A
  namespaced specialist type such as `agnthive:Code Reviewer` is now recognized,
  so footer enforcement applies instead of passing through as a foreign type.

- **Explicit per-key entry + centralized loop key (ADR-0005/0006).**
  `recordLoopBlock` carries the changed per-key entry explicitly
  (`{ mapKey, key, entry }`); `agentLoopKey` centralizes the
  `agentId || '_session'` fallback as the single source of truth for every
  per-agent loop-block site.

- **Architecture decision records (ADR-0001..0007)** documenting the
  subagent-footer scope, per-agent loop-block counter, `stop_hook_active`
  honoring, namespace stripping, explicit per-key entry, centralized loop key,
  and namespace-prefix identity.

### Changed

- **`/simplify` cleanups.** `hasPriorStopBlock` predicate encapsulates the
  prior-block policy check; `isAliasesLoaded` is the single source of truth for
  the alias-map loaded-ness predicate shared by the dispatcher and
  `shouldEnforceSubagentFooter`; `validateMapField` shares the map-field guard
  across the whole `map_*` event family; a redundant defensive spread in
  `emitLoopAwareBlock` was dropped; `handleUserPromptSubmit` resolves session
  paths once per turn; and `handleSubagentStop` short-circuits generic dispatch
  types before the label-extraction walk.

- **`make precommit`** — one-command local pre-push gate that chains the full
  repository self-check (`make validate`, which includes the tier-1
  `plugin-install-smoke` strict gate) plus `make lint`, `make test`, and
  `make hooks`. No model, network, or API keys required — the same no-spend
  gates CI runs. `make bench-precheck` (also no-spend) and `make bench-mock`
  remain separate optional add-ons.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Forced SDLC output style.** `output-styles/agnthive.md` carries
  `force-for-plugin: agnthive`, so enabling the plugin automatically applies the
  hook-gated SDLC style (phase order, specialist roles, stop-safe footers) to the
  main conversation without the user selecting an output style. The style
  teaches the contract upstream; the hooks still verify it. It modifies the main
  session prompt only — subagents keep their own agent prompts.
- **Subagent status line, on by default.** `scripts/subagent-statusline.mjs`
  (Node stdlib only) is wired via `settings.json` `subagentStatusLine` and
  renders one alias/role · status · effort · tokens · context-% row per running
  subagent. Degrades gracefully on empty or partial input; no configuration
  needed.
- **Two new `userConfig` knobs + a three-tier env bridge.** `log_max_bytes` and
  `ledger_max_bytes` join `enforcement_mode` as `userConfig` keys. Each runtime
  resolver now reads `AGNTHIVE_*` (explicit) > `CLAUDE_CREW_*` (legacy alias) >
  `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_*` (the `userConfig` bridge, lowest priority), so a
  `userConfig` value always applies unless an explicit env var overrides it.
- **Per-agent tool allowlists and reasoning effort.** Every agent frontmatter
  now pins a `tools` allowlist (Explorer and Code Reviewer read-only; Manager
  keeps all tools except `Edit`/`Write`/`NotebookEdit`) and a `model` reasoning
  `effort` (low/medium/high). Model pinning is intentionally omitted to keep the
  plugin model-agnostic.
- **Slash-skill argument hints.** All nine slash skills carry an
  `argument-hint` so the command palette previews the expected argument.
- **Tier-1 strict packaged-plugin validation, always-on.**
  `scripts/plugin-install-smoke.mjs` now strictly checks the `userConfig` schema
  (allowed `type` values; `default` matches type), parse-checks
  `scripts/subagent-statusline.mjs`, and validates the plugin `settings.json`
  shape (only `agent`/`subagentStatusLine` allowed). Wired into
  `node scripts/validate.mjs` as a new `checkPluginInstallSmoke` step so it runs
  in CI on every push/PR.
- **Tier-2 official `claude plugin validate --strict` in CI.** The validate
  workflow adds a Linux-only, best-effort step that runs the official CLI's
  strict manifest validator against `plugins/agnthive`. The CLI install is
  `continue-on-error`; a genuine `--strict` failure fails the shard, but an
  install flake skips cleanly so required checks stay green.

### Changed

- **TaskCompleted / TeammateIdle can optionally emit a structured block
  decision.** These exit-2 blocks may additionally write a
  `{"decision":"block","reason":...}` JSON object to stdout (same reason as the
  stderr message) when `AGNTHIVE_BLOCK_STDOUT_JSON=1` is set, so hosts that
  prefer stdout JSON over the exit code can receive the block intent + reason.
  The flag is **off by default**: with it unset, stdout stays empty and behavior
  is byte-identical to the legacy exit-2 + stderr block, because
  `decision:"block"` is the "continue with feedback" contract and it is
  unverified whether a host honors stdout JSON over the exit code for these
  events (emitting it unconditionally could weaken a hard stop). The write now
  uses `process.exitCode` + return instead of `process.exit` so the stdout
  payload flushes naturally. Full exit-2 removal remains gated on verifying that
  host-runtime contract.
- **Install flow is now marketplace-first across every surface.** The repository
  is a self-hosted plugin marketplace, so the canonical install is
  `claude plugin marketplace add C0FFEEC0DE/agnthive` then
  `claude plugin install agnthive@agnthive`, with
  `claude plugin update agnthive@agnthive` pulling updates straight from the
  repo. The root `README.md`, `index.html` landing page, `CLAUDE.md` Quick Start,
  and this README now lead with the marketplace-add flow instead of the
  clone-and-`claude plugin install ./plugins/agnthive` source-install path
  (which remains as a local/dev alternative).
- **The plugin ships disabled by default.** `defaultEnabled: false` in
  `plugin.json` means `claude plugin install` no longer auto-activates the
  hook-gated profile; the install flow adds `claude plugin enable agnthive@agnthive`
  as the explicit opt-in step.

- **Install flow is now marketplace-first across every surface.** The repository
  is a self-hosted plugin marketplace, so the canonical install is
  `claude plugin marketplace add C0FFEEC0DE/agnthive` then
  `claude plugin install agnthive@agnthive`, with
  `claude plugin update agnthive@agnthive` pulling updates straight from the
  repo. The root `README.md`, `index.html` landing page, `CLAUDE.md` Quick Start,
  and this README now lead with the marketplace-add flow instead of the
  clone-and-`claude plugin install ./plugins/agnthive` source-install path
  (which remains as a local/dev alternative).

### Fixed

- **Corrected the marketplace identifier in every install/update command.** The
  plugin README previously used `agnthive@C0FFEEC0DE`, but `C0FFEEC0DE` is the
  GitHub owner handle, not the marketplace name, and Claude Code requires
  marketplace names to be kebab-case (uppercase is invalid). The marketplace
  `name` in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is `agnthive`, so the correct
  address is `agnthive@agnthive` (`<plugin>@<marketplace>`). Updated install,
  update, disable, enable, uninstall, and `marketplace remove` commands
  accordingly, and corrected the explanatory text that misidentified the
  marketplace name as a "publisher identifier declared in plugin.json".

## [0.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-06-22

First beta of the distributable Claude Code plugin. The hook-gated
`discover → design → implement → verify → review → docs` workflow, the
specialist-role contracts, and the stop/handoff footer contract now run in a
Node 22+ runtime packaged as a plugin — no Bash, Python, `jq`, or GNU/coreutils
dependencies. The work follows the phased plan in
`docs/plans/2026-06-21-claude-code-plugin-node-production.md` and the frozen
contract in `docs/specs/claude-code-plugin-node-migration.md`.

### Added

- **Plugin manifest and distribution.** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` declares the
  plugin name, displayName, version, author, MIT license, keywords, the
  `hooks/hooks.json` entry, and a single `userConfig` key (`enforcement_mode`).
  Distribution is source-repository-based (marketplace copy of the plugin dir,
  no install-time build, no npm install).
- **Node 22+ hook runtime** under `modules/`: a single `hook-dispatcher.mjs` entry
  point serves all 19 hook registrations via `--event`, backed by event modules
  (`state.mjs`, `workflow.mjs`, `command-policy.mjs`, `verification.mjs`,
  `summary-contract.mjs`, `agents.mjs`, `transcripts.mjs`, `notifications.mjs`,
  `ledger.mjs`, `hook-input.mjs`, `hook-output.mjs`, `util.mjs`). Node standard
  library only — no `child_process`, no shell, no `eval`.
- **Append-only session state.** `state.mjs` replaces lock-protected
  read-modify-write JSON with append-only event records (exclusive-creation
  `wx` writes) plus a pure reducer and disposable snapshots (temp-file + atomic
  rename), removing the non-atomic initial write, shared-state race, and
  stale-lock TOCTOU from the legacy profile. A migration version is stamped on
  every event and snapshot.
- **Platform-neutral command policy.** `command-policy.mjs` inspects
  `tool_input.command` before it runs and gates `PreToolUse`,
  `PermissionRequest`, and `PermissionDenied`. It covers POSIX, PowerShell, and
  CMD spellings of destructive recursive deletion, disk formatting, privilege
  escalation, force pushes / destructive reset, remote-script bootstrap pipes,
  and release/deploy automation. Two modes: `advisory` (default, fail-open on
  the unknown) and `enforce` (fail-closed on unparseable indirection). Contract
  frozen in `docs/specs/command-policy.md`; behavior pinned by the corpus at
  `test/security/command-policy.corpus.mjs`.
- **Stop and subagent footer contracts.** `summary-contract.mjs` ports the
  footer parsing, completion gates, and block checklists, preserving the
  terminal-cancellation semantics (only `continue: false` + `stopReason`, never
  combined with `decision: "block"`) and the policy-stall reset on a genuine
  `UserPromptSubmit`.
- **Telemetry with rotation.** `notifications.mjs` appends structured JSONL
  records under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/logs` (`notification.jsonl`,
  `session-index.jsonl`, `pre-compact.jsonl`, `post-compact.jsonl`,
  `config-change.jsonl`, `instructions-loaded.jsonl`) built from a fixed field
  whitelist and serialized with `JSON.stringify`. Each stream rotates to
  `<name>.old` at `AGNTHIVE_LOG_MAX_BYTES` (1 MiB default). No credentials,
  full environment variables, or prompt/transcript contents are logged.
- **Progress ledger.** `ledger.mjs` re-injects compact context after
  compaction, capped at `AGNTHIVE_LEDGER_MAX_BYTES` (64 KiB default) with
  UTF-8-safe truncation.
- **Canonical agents and namespaced skills.** Eight agents under `agents/`
  with kebab-case canonical names; legacy persona aliases retained only in
  `assets/aliases.json` for transcript compatibility (no packaged symlinks).
  Skills under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with namespaced invocation
  (`/agnthive:review`). Workflow documents moved into `references/`
  as on-demand skill references.
- **Optional Node status line.** `scripts/statusline.mjs` reads one JSON object
  from stdin and prints `<cwd basename> | <model display name> | <output style>`.
  Node standard library only — no subprocess spawning, no shell, no reads of
  arbitrary user files. Opt in via the plugin's `statusLine` setting (not the
  global status line).
- **Plugin README.** Requirements, installation (marketplace and local/dev),
  configuration, optional status line, privacy & telemetry, uninstallation,
  legacy migration, troubleshooting, support & security reporting, and license.
- **Plugin-level LICENSE and SECURITY.md** shipped inside the plugin directory
  so marketplace installs receive them.
- **Supply-chain controls.** CodeQL (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`),
  dependency review (`dependency-review.yml`), Dependabot
  (`.github/dependabot.yml`), and an SBOM generated with Syft and attached to
  the GitHub Release. Minimal GitHub token permissions in the release workflow
  (`contents: write` for release creation; `id-token: write` reserved for future
  signing).
- **Tag-cut release flow.** `.github/workflows/release.yml` fires only on a
  `v*` SemVer tag, builds one artifact via `git archive` from a clean checkout,
  tests the exact unpacked artifact (structural + `node --check` + optional
  install smoke), attaches `sbom.spdx.json`, and creates the GitHub Release
  with `--verify-tag`. Documented in `docs/release.md`.
- **Threat model.** `docs/threat-model.md` records the trust boundary, the
  seven threats and their mitigations, and the residual risks.
- **Stage 5 `dispatch_enforced` hard guard.** A benchmark task with
  `dispatch_contract.mode: "enforced"` now forces dispatch at the harness level:
  `UserPromptSubmit` stashes `dispatch_contract_mode` to session state from the
  `BENCHMARK_DISPATCH_CONTRACT` marker, and a new `PreToolUse` registration for
  `Edit|MultiEdit|Write|NotebookEdit` denies root edits until at least one
  required specialist role has a real `SubagentStart` recorded. Once the
  specialist starts, edits flow (including the specialist's own). The guard is
  inert for non-bench sessions and for `observed`/`standard` modes. The
  `subagent-architect-refactor-lite` smoke canary is converted to `enforced`,
  unblocking the merge-blocking functional gate (dispatch failures are excluded
  from the functional line under `enforced`/`observed`) while the separate
  `dispatch-enforced` line honestly reports whether the guard produced a real
  dispatch. Hook cases and unit assertions cover deny-before-dispatch,
  allow-after-dispatch, and inert-under-standard.
- **Environment-variable namespace `AGNTHIVE_*`.** The public env knobs
  (`AGNTHIVE_POLICY`, `AGNTHIVE_LOG_MAX_BYTES`, `AGNTHIVE_LEDGER_MAX_BYTES`,
  `AGNTHIVE_PROGRESS_FILE`, `AGNTHIVE_BRIEF_DIR`, `AGNTHIVE_REVIEW_DIR`) use the
  `agnthive` brand; the legacy `CLAUDE_CREW_*` names are read as aliases for one
  release cycle. The default progress-ledger path moved from
  `<projectDir>/.claude-crew/progress.md` to `<projectDir>/.agnthive/progress.md`.

### Changed

- **Runtime moved from Bash to Node ESM.** The legacy 18 events / 19
  registrations / 20 shell files (19 registration scripts + shared `lib.sh`,
  1564 lines) are replaced by the Node dispatcher and event modules. Every
  hook registration now uses exec form (`command: "node"` + `args` array, no
  `shell: true`).
- **Dangerous-intent default changed to `advisory`.** The legacy Bash runtime
  hard-denied unconditionally via `command_is_hard_denied_by_profile`. The Node
  runtime defaults to `advisory` (fail-open on the unknown) and exposes
  `enforce` (fail-closed) as an opt-in. This is a deliberate new default, not a
  mechanical port — recorded as an intentional behavior delta in the migration
  spec.
- **Cross-platform CI.** CI runs on `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, and
  `windows-latest` across Node 22 and the current LTS, replacing Python/Shell
  workflows. Paths with spaces, CRLF inputs, UTF-8 input chunks, and plugin
  cache paths are exercised on each OS.

### Removed

- **No Bash, Python, or `jq` in the plugin runtime.** `scripts/plugin-install-smoke.mjs`
  (Check 3) and `scripts/check-no-legacy-runtime.mjs` fail if any `.py`/`.sh`
  file appears in the packaged plugin runtime, so a legacy regression cannot
  silently return.
- **No global config mutation.** The legacy profile copied hooks, agents, and
  skills directly into `~/.claude` and mutated `settings.json` in place. The
  plugin never reads or writes `~/.claude/settings.json`; all configuration is
  environment variables and the plugin-scoped `userConfig`. The plugin's
  `settings.json` (if present) supports only `agent` and `subagentStatusLine`.

### Security

- The command policy is defense-in-depth, not a sandbox. Its supported syntax
  and fail-closed `enforce` behavior are explicit; residual limitations (no
  shell-grammar parsing, no homoglyph normalization, no environment awareness,
  bare-path shell matching) are documented in `SECURITY.md` and
  `docs/specs/command-policy.md`.
- The runtime makes no network calls and sends nothing off the local machine
  (verified: no `fetch`/`http`/`https`/`child_process` imports in `modules/`).
- `claude plugin validate --strict` was run by the integrator (exit 0) prior to
  this beta; the release workflow re-validates the exact unpacked artifact
  before creating a release.
